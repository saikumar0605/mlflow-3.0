Here's a step-by-step guide to help you get started:\n\n**Step 1: Get Familiar with Python**\n\nDjango is built on top of Python, so it's essential to have a good grasp of Python basics. If you're new to Python, start with:\n\n* Basic syntax and data types\n* Control structures (if-else, for loops, etc.)\n* Functions and modules\n* Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts\n\nYou can use online resources like Codecademy, DataCamp, or Python.org to learn Python.\n\n**Step 2: Set up your Environment**\n\n1. Install Python: Download and install Python from the official website.\n2. Install a Code Editor or IDE: Choose a code editor or IDE that you're comfortable with, such as PyCharm, Visual Studio Code, or Sublime Text.\n3. Install a Virtual Environment: Django requires a virtual environment to isolate dependencies. You can use tools like virtualenv or conda to create a virtual environment.\n\n**Step 3: Learn the Basics of Django**\n\n1. Start with the official Django documentation: The official Django documentation is an exhaustive resource that covers everything from basics to advanced topics.\n2.
